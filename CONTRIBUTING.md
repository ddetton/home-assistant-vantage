## ðŸ”¨ Set up Development Environment

To set up your development environment, you can either use a venv or a devcontainer.

### Using a Virtual Environment (recommended)

Create a venv in the root of the project:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

Activate the venv:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

Install the dependencies:

```bash
./scripts/setup
```

Start Home Assistant:

```bash
./scripts/develop
```

### Using a Development Container

Alternatively, you can use a [Development Container](https://containers.dev/) to set up your
development environment.

> **Note**
> Using a development container is not as fast as a venv, and zeroconf discovery will not work.

To use a development container, you need to have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) installed. You also need to install the
[Dev Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)
extension for Visual Studio Code.

Open the project in Visual Studio Code, and you should be prompted to reopen the project in a
container. If you are not prompted, you can open the command palette and select
*Dev Containers: Reopen in Container*.

Once the container is running, you can start Home Assistant by either running `./scripts/start`
in the terminal, or by opening the command palette and selecting *Tasks: Run Task* and then
*Run Home Assistant*.

## âœ¨ Submit your work

Submit your improvements, fixes, and new features to one at a time, using GitHub [Pull Requests](https://docs.github.com/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests).
Good pull requests remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated commits. If your contribution involves a significant amount of work or substantial changes to any part of the project, please open an issue to discuss it first to avoid any wasted or duplicate effort.

## ðŸŽ¨ Style guidelines

We use `mypy`, `ruff`, and `black` for code linting and formatting. Linting helps ensure code quality and consistency throughout the project.

To run linting locally, execute the following command:

```bash
./scripts/lint
```

This command will run the linting tools, checking for against the project linting rules.

While you're free to use your preferred linters or editor plugins, please ensure that your changes adhere to our linting rules and pass the CI checks.

## ðŸš€ Publish a release

Update the version number in `custom_components/vantage/manifest.json`, and commit the change to source control.

```bash
git add custom_components/vantage/manifest.json
git commit -m "Preparing release v1.2.3"
```

Tag the release, eg:

```bash
git tag v1.2.3
git push && git push --tags
```

Releases are published automatically to HACS when a new tag is pushed to the repository.
