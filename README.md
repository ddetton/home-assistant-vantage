Home Assistant integration for Vantage InFusion home automation controllers, using [aiovantage](https://github.com/loopj/aiovantage).

## Features

The features of this integration include:

- Control Vantage devices (lights, shades, motion sensors, etc) as [Home Assistant entities](#platforms).
- Trigger automations based on Vantage keypad button presses, using [events](#events).
- Start Vantage tasks from Home Assistant, using [services](#services).
- Automatic Vantage controller discovery (via mDNS).
- UI-based configuration (config flow).
- Entity state updated using [Local Push](https://www.home-assistant.io/blog/2016/02/12/classifying-the-internet-of-things/#classifiers).
- Entities and devices are automatically synchronized upon restart of Home Assistant when changed in Vantage.
- Non-blocking I/O, via asyncio and [aiovantage](https://github.com/loopj/aiovantage).
- Uses SSL connections by default, with automatic reconnection.

## Prerequisites

If your Vantage controller requires authentication (most do by default) you'll need to know a username and password to continue.

If you don't know your username and password, you can reset the password for the *administrator* user if you have physical access to the controller. When resetting your password, it will revert to the serial number of your controller. Alternatively, if you are working with a Vantage dealer, they can provide these credentials.

If you aren't using the default *administrator* user, ensure that the following permissions are enabled for your user: *Read State*, *Write State*, *Read Config*.

## Installation

The easiest way to install this integration is by using [HACS](https://hacs.xyz).

If you have HACS installed, you can add the Vantage integration as a custom repository by using this My button:

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and open a repository inside the Home Assistant Community Store.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=loopj&repository=home-assistant-vantage&category=integration)

If you aren't using HACS, you can download the [latest release](https://github.com/loopj/home-assistant-vantage/releases/latest/download/vantage.zip) and extract the contents to your Home Assistant `config/custom_components` directory.
</details>

## Configuration

Adding Vantage to your Home Assistant instance can be done via the user interface, by using this My button:

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and start setting up a new integration.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/config_flow_start.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config_flow_start/?domain=vantage)

Vantage can be auto-discovered by Home Assistant. If an instance was found, it will be shown as **Discovered**. You can then set it up right away.

If it wasnâ€™t discovered automatically, you can set up a manual integration entry:

- Go to [**Settings > Devices & Services**](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/integrations).
- In the bottom right corner, select the [**Add Integration**](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config_flow_start?domain=vantage) button.
- From the list, select **Vantage InFusion**.
- Follow the instructions on screen to complete the setup.

## Platforms

### Lights

Vantage *Load* and *Load Group* objects will appear as lights in Home Assistant, except for loads labeled as *Relay* or *Motor* in Design Center.

Additionally, color loads connected to a Vantage DMX or DMX/DALI Gateway will appear as lights in Home Assistant.

### Switches

Vantage *Load* objects labeled as *Relay* or *Motor* will appear as switches in Home Assistant. If you have a relay or motor load that you'd like to show up as a different type of entity, you can use the [change device type of a switch](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/switch_as_x/) integration.

Additionally, Vantage *GMem* objects (variables) with a type of *Boolean* will be created as switches in Home Assistant, but are hidden by default.

### Binary Sensors

Vantage *DryContact* objects (motion sensors, etc) will appear as binary sensors in Home Assistant.

### Number Entities

Vantage *GMem* objects (variables) with numeric types will be created as number entities in Home Assistant, but are hidden by default.

### Text Entities

Vantage *GMem* objects (variables) with a type of *Text* will be created as text entities in Home Assistant, but are hidden by default.

### Sensors

Certain Vantage dimmer modules have built-in power, current, and temperature sensors. These are created as sensors in Home Assistant, but are not enabled by default to reduce clutter. You can enable them from the Home Assistant settings.

### Covers

Supported Vantage *Blind* and *BlindGroup* objects will appear as covers in Home Assistant.

## Events

This integration will fire events on the Home Assistant event bus which can be used to trigger automations. You can test events using the [events developer tools](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/developer_events/) page in the Home Assistant UI.

### `vantage_button_pressed`

This event is fired when a button is pressed on a Vantage keypad. The following is an example of the payload:

```json
{
    "button_id": 250,
    "button_name": "Lights",
    "button_position": 1,
    "button_text1": "lights",
    "button_text2": "",
    "station_id": 249,
    "station_name": "Office Keypad"
}
```

| Attribute | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `button_id` | The Vantage ID of the button that was pressed. |
| `button_name` | The name of the button that was pressed. |
| `button_position` | The position on the keypad of the button that was pressed. |
| `button_text1` | The first line of text on the button that was pressed. |
| `button_text2` | The second line of text on the button that was pressed. |
| `station_id` | The Vantage ID of the keypad containing the button that was pressed. |
| `station_name` | The name of the keypad containing the button that was pressed. |

### `vantage_button_released`

This event is fired when a button is released on a Vantage keypad. It has the same payload as the `vantage_button_pressed` event.

### `vantage_task_started`

This event is fired when a Vantage task is started. It's worth noting that this event can be fired multiple times for a single button press, since buttons have press, release, and hold actions, and tasks can be configured to start on any of these actions.

The following is an example of the payload:

```json
{
    "task_id": 683,
    "task_name": "Toggle Office Lights"
}
```

| Attribute | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `task_id` | The Vantage ID of the task that was started. |
| `task_name` | The name of the task that was started. |

### `vantage_task_stopped`

This event is fired when a Vantage task is stopped. It has the same payload as the `vantage_task_started` event.

### `vantage_task_state_changed`

This event is fired when a Vantage task changes it's LED state. The following is an example of the payload:

```json
{
    "task_id": 683,
    "task_name": "Toggle Office Lights",
    "task_state": 1
}
```

| Attribute | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `task_id` | The Vantage ID of the task that changed state. |
| `task_name` | The name of the task that changed state. |
| `task_state` | The new LED state of the task. |

## Services

This integration exposes the following services which can be called from automations.

### `vantage.start_task`

You can start a Vantage task by calling the `vantage.start_task` service, with either the Vantage ID of the task, or the task's name.

### `vantage.stop_task`

You can stop a Vantage task by calling the `vantage.stop_task` service, with either the Vantage ID of the task, or the task's name.
